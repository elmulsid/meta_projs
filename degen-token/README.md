# Degen Token 

## Description

The project creates a ERC20 token and deploy it on the AVAX FUJI Chain for Degen Gaming.
The project allows only the owner to mint tokens. The users can transfer, redeem and burn tokens. They can also check their balance


### Executing

Compile the Contract:
Compile the DegenToken.sol in https://remix.ethereum.org/ 

Deploy the Contract:

Change the environment to Injected Provider instead of Remix VM. Otherwise it will not work.

Your account should have enough AVAX to be able to deploy the contract

### Help
For common issues encountered while compiling or deploying the contract, refer to the Solidity documentation (https://docs.soliditylang.org/) for troubleshooting steps. Additionally, online communities and forums dedicated to Ethereum development can provide valuable assistance.
