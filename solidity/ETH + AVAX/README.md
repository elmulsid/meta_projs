# Voting Contract

This Solidity contract implements a simple voting system on the blockchain. It allows users to register, cast votes (Yes or No), and retrieve the total number of votes cast.

## Description

The contract maintains a record of registered voters and their votes. Voters can register and cast their votes only once. The contract keeps track of the total number of votes for "Yes" and "No" options.

## Features

Voter registration
Casting votes (Yes or No)
Calculating total votes

## Security Considerations
While this is a basic implementation, keep in mind that real-world voting systems require robust security measures. This contract does not implement features like anonymity or verifiability, which are crucial for secure voting systems.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Solidity compiler (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/installing-solidity.html)
Development environment with Solidity support (e.g., Visual Studio Code with Solidity extension)
Understanding of Solidity programming

### Deployment

Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the compiled bytecode to a blockchain network (e.g., test network).

### Interaction

Users can interact with the contract functions through a web3 interface or a dedicated blockchain development to
